# Welcome to Home of TDD!

Welcome to the **Home of TDD**, a place where we dive deep into the practice of Test-Driven Development. TDD is not just a technique for writing tests before writing the code that fulfills them; it's a philosophy that helps developers create better, more reliable software.

In this repository, we'll explore TDD through three structured layers, each focusing on different aspects of TDD. Whether you're a beginner looking to understand the basics, or an experienced developer seeking advanced techniques, these layers will guide your journey and deepen your understanding of TDD.

## Layer 1: So Many Fundamentals -- Time to learn them!

Welcome to the first layer of your TDD journey. This section sets the foundation, introducing you to the core principles and practices of Test-Driven Development. Here you will start with the basics: understanding what TDD is, why it's beneficial, and how you can start implementing it in your daily coding activities.

### Introduction to TDD

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach where tests are written before the code that needs to pass the tests. This may seem backward at first, but it's a proven method to design more thoughtful and efficient programs.

To give you a practical start, visit the [sample-tdd repository](https://github.com/css-software-engineering-studio/sample-tdd), a specially crafted educational resource to introduce you to Test Driven Development. This repository includes a basic project setup across multiple programming languages like C#, Java, C++, Python, Dart, and JavaScript, with each language's section specifically tailored to familiarize you with their respective TDD frameworks and best practices.

### Additional Learning Resources

- Beyond the core instructional content, two PDF documents are provided to enhance your understanding and application of unit testing concepts:

  > - [**PRIMER.PDF:**](https://github.com/css-software-engineering-studio/sample-tdd/blob/main/PRIMER.pdf) This document is derived from discussions with students who have previously engaged with TDD, offering practical insights and firsthand experiences.
  >   - A continiously-updated version of this as a [Google Document can be found here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Uxb2fVq267BSKKTXfm6147A4C6zFFDlfIKALhYliaSc/edit?usp=sharing)
  > - [**UNITTESTING.PDF:**](https://github.com/css-software-engineering-studio/sample-tdd/blob/main/UNITTESTING.pdf) Contains supplemental information that expands further on unit testing techniques and best practices.

  > - [**For C#**](https://github.com/unicodeveloper/awesome-tdd?tab=readme-ov-file#tdd-in-c)

## Layer 2: Beyond The Fundamentals – Exploring The Depths

In this section, we investigate deeper into the world of Test-Driven Development (TDD) by exploring a variety of advanced topics that not only challenge but also empower developers to refine their testing strategies. Each additional topic underscores the value of TDD and advocates for its adoption due to the specific benefits it introduces in different contexts of software development.

- **Test First vs. Test Driven:**

  - This article explains the nuanced differences between writing tests before coding (Test First) and Test-Driven Development where the test creation itself drives the design of the software.
  - [**Test First vs. Test Driven**](https://dev.to/mindplay/test-driven-vs-test-first-24ea)
  - Understanding these distinctions helps clarify why TDD, as a more structured approach, can lead to better design decisions and more maintainable code compared to simply writing tests first without integrating them into the design process.

- **Test Driven Development vs Behavior Driven Development:**

  - This comparison sheds light on TDD’s approach focused on the technical aspects and functionality of components versus BDD’s focus on the system’s behavior from the perspective of its stakeholders.
  - [**Test Driven Development vs Behavior Driven Development**](https://joshldavis.com/2013/05/27/difference-between-tdd-and-bdd/)
  - Understanding these distinctions helps clarify why TDD is essential for developers looking to ensure that all system components perform as intended while BDD is beneficial for aligning development with business requirements, and primarily just an 'stylistic extension' of TDD.

- **Mocking / Test Doubles:**

  - A comprehensive guide on using mocks, stubs, and fakes which are essential in testing environments where certain objects need to be simulated.
  - [**Mocking / Test Doubles**](https://blog.pragmatists.com/test-doubles-fakes-mocks-and-stubs-1a7491dfa3da)
  - This section gighlights how TDD supports robust testing by isolating the unit of code and replacing external dependencies, which increases test reliability and execution speed.

- **Refactoring Hell -- How to Avoid It:**
  - Discusses practical strategies to manage and mitigate the challenges of extensive refactoring, common in iterative and incremental development models like TDD.
  - [**Refactoring Hell -- How to avoid it.**](https://wiki.c2.com/?RefactoringHell)
  - This section demonstrates how TDD can minimize the risks associated with refactoring since continuous testing ensures that each change preserves the existing functionality.
