# Welcome to the Home of TDD!

Welcome to **Home of TDD**, your ultimate gateway to mastering Test-Driven Development (TDD). TDD is a transformative approach to software development that advocates for creating tests before you write the corresponding code. This might seem unconventional at first, but it is a disciplined method to ensure your code does exactly what it’s supposed to do.

In this repository, we've structured our content into three layers, elaborating on various dimensions of TDD. Whether you're just starting or seeking to refine your TDD skills, these layers are curated to boost your understanding and application of this critical practice.

## Layer 0: Why TDD?

Discover the essentials of TDD and why it's pivotal in modern software development:

- **Enhance Code Quality:** TDD leads to better designed, cleaner, and more reliable code. By writing tests first, developers focus on requirements before writing the code, reducing the likelihood of bugs.
- **Boost Confidence:** With TDD, every feature is tested, giving developers confidence that their code works as expected. This confidence makes it safer and easier to improve the codebase without fearing breaks.
- **Facilitate Refactoring:** Since TDD involves testing every small functionality, refactoring becomes less risky. You can improve the design of your code anytime with the assurance that you have tests to catch any breakages.
- **Documentation:** Tests written in TDD serve as a living documentation for your code. They explain what the code does and how it's supposed to behave, making onboarding easier for new developers.

These introductory insights are just the tip of the iceberg! Proceed to the next layers for an in-depth exploration of fundamentals, advanced concepts, and practical applications of TDD.

## Layer 1: So Many Fundamentals -- Time to learn them!

Welcome to the first layer of your TDD journey. This section sets the foundation, introducing you to the core principles and practices of Test-Driven Development. Here you will start with the basics: understanding what TDD is, why it's beneficial, and how you can start implementing it in your daily coding activities.

### Discover "sample-tdd" - A Comprehensive Introduction to Test-Driven Development

To get started with practical experience, check out the ["sample-tdd" repository](https://github.com/css-software-engineering-studio/sample-tdd) on GitHub. This educational tool is designed to help beginners understand the fundamentals of Test-Driven Development (TDD). The repository contains a basic project structure for a variety of programming languages including C#, Java, C++, Python, Dart, and JavaScript. Each section is meticulously tailored to introduce you to the TDD frameworks and best practices specific to that language, providing a structured learning path.

For further learning and to test your understanding, consider exploring the [tdd-sample repository](https://github.com/mehdihadeli/tdd-sample). This repository offers a more comprehensive codebase, allowing you to interact with fully implemented features. You can set up the project, observe its operations, and understand its successes and failures. This hands-on experience is invaluable for gaining a deeper insight into the practical aspects of TDD.

## Layer 2: Beyond The Fundamentals – Exploring The Depths

In this section, we investigate deeper into the world of Test-Driven Development (TDD) by exploring a variety of advanced topics that not only challenge but also empower developers to refine their testing strategies. Each additional topic underscores the value of TDD and advocates for its adoption due to the specific benefits it introduces in different contexts of software development.

- **Test First vs. Test Driven:**

  - This article explains the nuanced differences between writing tests before coding (Test First) and Test-Driven Development where the test creation itself drives the design of the software.
  - [**Test First vs. Test Driven**](https://dev.to/mindplay/test-driven-vs-test-first-24ea)
  - Understanding these distinctions helps clarify why TDD, as a more structured approach, can lead to better design decisions and more maintainable code compared to simply writing tests first without integrating them into the design process.

- **Mocking / Test Doubles:**

  - A comprehensive guide on using mocks, stubs, and fakes which are essential in testing environments where certain objects need to be simulated.
  - [**Mocking / Test Doubles**](https://blog.pragmatists.com/test-doubles-fakes-mocks-and-stubs-1a7491dfa3da)
  - This section highlights how TDD supports robust testing by isolating the unit of code and replacing external dependencies, which increases test reliability and execution speed.

- **Refactoring Hell -- How to Avoid It:**

  - Discusses practical strategies to manage and mitigate the challenges of extensive refactoring, common in iterative and incremental development models like TDD.
  - [**Refactoring Hell -- How to avoid it.**](https://wiki.c2.com/?RefactoringHell)
  - This section demonstrates how TDD can minimize the risks associated with refactoring since continuous testing ensures that each change preserves the existing functionality.

- **Test Driven Development vs Behavior Driven Development:**

  - This comparison sheds light on TDD’s approach focused on the technical aspects and functionality of components versus BDD’s focus on the system’s behavior from the perspective of its stakeholders.
  - [**Test Driven Development vs Behavior Driven Development**](https://joshldavis.com/2013/05/27/difference-between-tdd-and-bdd/)
  - Understanding these distinctions helps clarify why TDD is essential for developers looking to ensure that all system components perform as intended while BDD is beneficial for aligning development with business requirements, and primarily just an 'stylistic extension' of TDD.
