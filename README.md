# Welcome to Home of TDD!

Welcome to the **Home of TDD**, a place where we dive deep into the practice of Test-Driven Development. TDD is not just a technique for writing tests before writing the code that fulfills them; it's a philosophy that helps developers create better, more reliable software.

In this repository, we'll explore TDD through three structured layers, each focusing on different aspects of TDD. Whether you're a beginner looking to understand the basics, or an experienced developer seeking advanced techniques, these layers will guide your journey and deepen your understanding of TDD.

## Layer 1: So Many Fundamentals -- Time to learn them!.

...

## Layer 2: Applying The Fundamentals -- A lot of fun!.

...

## Layer 3: Beyond The Fundamentals -- Why TDD?

Thank you for visiting the Home of TDD. Start exploring each layer at your own pace and embrace the robust practice of Test-Driven Development!
