# Welcome to Home of TDD!

Welcome to the **Home of TDD**, a place where we dive deep into the practice of Test-Driven Development. TDD is not just a technique for writing tests before writing the code that fulfills them; it's a philosophy that helps developers create better, more reliable software.

In this repository, we'll explore TDD through three structured layers, each focusing on different aspects of TDD. Whether you're a beginner looking to understand the basics, or an experienced developer seeking advanced techniques, these layers will guide your journey and deepen your understanding of TDD.

## Layer 1: So Many Fundamentals -- Time to learn them!

Welcome to the first layer of your TDD journey. This section sets the foundation, introducing you to the core principles and practices of Test-Driven Development. Here you will start with the basics: understanding what TDD is, why it's beneficial, and how you can start implementing it in your daily coding activities.

### Introduction to TDD

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach where tests are written before the code that needs to pass the tests. This may seem backward at first, but it's a proven method to design more thoughtful and efficient programs.

### Explore "sample-tdd" - Your Hands-on Starter Repository

To give you a practical start, visit the [sample-tdd repository](https://github.com/css-software-engineering-studio/sample-tdd), a specially crafted educational resource to introduce you to Test Driven Development. This repository includes a basic project setup across multiple programming languages like C#, Java, C++, Python, Dart, and JavaScript, with each language's section specifically tailored to familiarize you with their respective TDD frameworks and best practices.

### Additional Learning Resources

- Beyond the core instructional content, two PDF documents are provided to enhance your understanding and application of unit testing concepts:

  > - [**PRIMER.PDF:**](https://github.com/css-software-engineering-studio/sample-tdd/blob/main/PRIMER.pdf) This document is derived from discussions with students who have previously engaged with TDD, offering practical insights and firsthand experiences.
  >   - A continiously-updated version of this as a [Google Document can be found here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Uxb2fVq267BSKKTXfm6147A4C6zFFDlfIKALhYliaSc/edit?usp=sharing)
  > - [**UNITTESTING.PDF:**](https://github.com/css-software-engineering-studio/sample-tdd/blob/main/UNITTESTING.pdf) Contains supplemental information that expands further on unit testing techniques and best practices.
